                I really enjoy to working with react.
                about two years ago I started to learning javascript and after a while react js
                I tried jquery, node js, SQL, java and ....;But I decided to learn react first
                because It's more exciting against other frameworks or languages; 
                So this site that created with React-Js has no back-end 
                But include ajax request with helping 
                <a href='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'> jsonPlaceHolder </a> 
                site that you will see that further.
                if you have any opnion, comment or idea you can contact me with email 
                that is at the end of the page.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default ability;
